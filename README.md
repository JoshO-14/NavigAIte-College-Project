# NavigAIte-College-Project

NavigAIte College is an intelligent college planner and tracker designed to help high school students figure out their best path after graduation.

Every year, 3 out of 4 high schoolers are unsure about higher education and what colleges fit their goals. This project uses AI and large language models (LLMs) to change that — by analyzing a student’s current info (GPA, extracurriculars, interests, test scores, and intended major) and comparing it with real college data like application trends, acceptance rates, and success factors.

The goal is to show students where they currently stand, which colleges match their profile, and how to maximize their chances of getting in through personalized suggestions, improvement resources, and progress tracking.
